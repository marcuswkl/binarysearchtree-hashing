# data-structures

You are required to implement a group project with appropriate data structures and algorithms for real-world problems. Each group needs to use appropriate data structures and algorithms to implement a visualization or simulation for any TWO (2) problems listed in the following section (Problems List). You are encouraged to use Java programming language for the implementation; however, you are allowed to choose the programming language of your choice.

The marks will be based on the use of appropriate data structures, general (support multiple data types), the accuracy of algorithms, and support the essential operations involved in it. For example, if you choose to implement a simulation for a Red-Black tree, it should support the insert (add node) and delete (remove node) operations.

## Problems List
- Shortest pathfinding
- Hashing
- Binary Search Tree
- Red-Black Tree
- Huffman coding
- String matching (except na√Øve)
- Dijkstra algorithm
